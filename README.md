To submit a code change, please [fork this repository](https://github.com/mcongrove/ForekastPebble/fork) to your personal GitHub account. After making your changes, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/mcongrove/ForekastPebble/pulls). Your changes will be reviewed by one of the project administrators for various checks, including:

 * Best practices
 * Performance
 * Code conflicts
 * Code standards (yes, we will reject ugly code; see next section)

Code changes that fail to meet the above standards, or for any other reason at the discretion of the project administrators, will be rejected. _We will do our best to work with you to improve your pull request until it's deemed acceptable._

If you're taking on a bug, please comment on the [Issue](https://github.com/mcongrove/ForekastMobile/issues) so that work isn't duplicated.

If you'd like to add a completely new feature, please submit an [Issue](https://github.com/mcongrove/ForekastMobile/issues) so that we may all discuss the benefits. This is to ensure that you don't waste your time developing a feature we won't implement.

Anyone who submits a few successfully merged pull requests will be added to the contributors list, at the discretion of project administrators.
